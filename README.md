To start the Installation process, we need to start at Microsoft Azure and create Virtual Machine (VM) that is able to handle the program we need to set up osTicket. It's preffered to use a Windows 10 VM with at least 4 virtual CPU's. A Username and Password has to be created to login the VM. Then, when all is set up and ready, Remote Desktop is fired up to connect to the Virtual Machine to start the Installation.

With the IP address entered into the Remote Desktop program, we login using the username and password we used to set up the VM.

After the login and basic setup on the Virtual Machine, we head into Control Panel -> Programs and Features and enable Internet Information Servies (or IIS) to ensure that osTicket is ready to run.
